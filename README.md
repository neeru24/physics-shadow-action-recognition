# 🧠 Physics-Based Shadow Action Recognition

A research-focused project that explores **human action recognition using shadow dynamics and physics-inspired features**.  
Instead of relying solely on appearance-based cues, this project leverages **motion, geometry, and physical properties of shadows** to recognize actions more robustly.

---

## 📌 Overview

Human action recognition is traditionally performed using RGB videos, which can be sensitive to lighting, appearance, and background noise.  
This project investigates an alternative approach by focusing on **shadows** as a primary source of information.

Shadows:
- Preserve motion patterns
- Reduce appearance bias
- Improve robustness in privacy-sensitive scenarios

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Analyze how **shadow motion and shape** correlate with human actions  
- Apply **physics-inspired constraints** (motion continuity, dynamics)
- Improve recognition accuracy under challenging lighting conditions
- Explore shadow-based recognition as a **privacy-preserving solution**

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts Used

- Shadow extraction and segmentation  
- Motion analysis from shadow silhouettes  
- Temporal feature modeling  
- Physics-aware action representation  
- Classification of human actions based on shadow behavior
