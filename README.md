# Physics-Based Shadow-Depth Action Recognition

A computer vision system that estimates 3D distance between hand and mouth using shadow physics, enabling accurate action recognition for applications like eating/smoking detection.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Physics-Based Depth Estimation**: Uses shadow properties and inverse square law instead of traditional geometry
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes video at 15-30 FPS on standard hardware
- **Multiple Action Classification**: Detects eating, drinking, smoking, face-touching
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time distance overlay and intensity matrix visualization
- **Calibration System**: Adapts to different lighting conditions and setups
